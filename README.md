# cglossa

## Installation
### 
Glossa is written in Clojure, which compiles to Java bytecode and runs on the 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Java needs to be installed on your
machine, which is probably already the case;  otherwise it can be downloaded from
https://www.java.com or (preferably) installed via the package manager for your system.

Glossa also requires MySQL, which can probably also be installed via your package
manager or alternatively downloaded from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
Glossa has been tested with MySQL versions >= 5.1.73.

Finally, the default search engine used by Glossa is the IMS Open Corpus Workbench 
(CWB). Some packages are required to compile this system. In Debian-based distributions 
you may need to run:

    apt-get install flex libglib2.0-dev gawk

Follow the installation instructions of [The IMS Open Corpus Workbench
(CWB)](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/download.php#svn). Check out the latest
version from SVN, as described at the bottom of the page, to get support for
UTF-8-encoded corpora.

### Database setup
Glossa uses a core database as well as a separate database for each corpus.
This makes it easy to copy a corpus to a different server (just dump its database 
on the old machine and run the create_corpus.sh script and subsequently import the 
database on the new machine) or to remove a particular corpus (just drop its database
and remove the relevant row in the core database). It also leads to a significant
simplification and speedup of all code related to importing and searching corpora.

In order to set up the core database, run the `src/mysql/setup.sh` script. This
will create the core database with the name `glossa__core`. If you want to change
the prefix used for the core and all the corpus-specific databases to something
other than **glossa**, set the environment variable `GLOSSA_PREFIX`.

The variables `GLOSSA_DB_USER` (default: "glossa") and `GLOSSA_DB_PASSWORD`
also need to be set accordingly.

The variables should be set in `config.sh` in the root of the project. For example:

    export GLOSSA_DB_USER='glossa'
    export GLOSSA_DB_PASSWORD='GlossaPassword'
    export GLOSSA_PREFIX='myglossa'

With the above config, the following commands:

    cd src/mysql
    ./setup.sh

will create the core database with the name **myglossa__core**, and all corpus-specific
databases will also get a **myglossa** prefix instead of **glossa**. To change only the
name of the core database, set `GLOSSA_CORE` in `config.sh`.

### Creating a corpus
The script `src/mysql/create_corpus.sh` creates a row for the new corpus in the
core database as well as a separate database for the corpus. For example, the command
`src/mysql/create_corpus.sh mycorpus` will create a row in the core database for
the **mycorpus** corpus as well as a database called **glossa_mycorpus** (or optionally with
a different prefix, as explained above). For corpora encoded with the IMS Open Corpus 
Workbench (the default), Glossa will expect to find a corpus with the ID **mycorpus** in 
the CWB registry.

If the corpus has metadata, they can be imported using the scripts 
`src/mysql/import_metadata_categories.sh CORPUS CATEGORIES.TSV` and 
`src/mysql/import_metadata_values.sh CORPUS VALUES.TSV CATEGORIES.TSV`, where *CORPUS*
is the "short name" of the corpus (e.g. **mycorpus**). **TODO**: Describe the format
of the TSV files.

### Creating local users
New users can be added using `src/mysql/adduser.sh`. For the script to work,
the environment variables, described above, need to be set properly.

## Development on Glossa itself

### Quick start:
Make sure that `config.sh` is set up as described above, and run
`./start_dev.sh`. The webserver is started by default at port 10555. When you
see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js" in 21.36
seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to `http://localhost:10555` and enjoy. The
port can be changed by setting `PORT` in `config.sh`.

Figwheel may also be started without `rlwrap`, but it will then be missing line
editing, persistent history and completion.

### REPL

Clojure REPL can be started in a terminal: `lein repl`, or from Emacs: open a
clj/cljs file in the project, then do `M-x cider-jack-in` (make sure
CIDER is up to date). You may call `(run)` in REPL, which is equivalent to
`lein run` in the startup script.

### External SAML login

External SAML login (used e.g. by Feide) is done via an external daemon that
creates a new session (and possibly a new user) after successful
authentication. To enable external login, `SAML_LOGIN_URL` and
`SAML_LOGOUT_URL` must be set in `config.sh`. You may also optionally set
`SAML_LOGIN_IMG` with the URL to the logo of the identity provider. At the Text
Laboratory, the URLs for using Feide are as follows:

    export SAML_LOGIN_URL='https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/glossa2/login/feide'
    export SAML_LOGOUT_URL='https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/glossa2/logout/feide'
    export SAML_LOGIN_IMG='https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/glossa2/logo/feide.png'

### Deployment

If you want to enable external login, the SAML environment variables need to be
set during building the application. Therefore, the best way to build Glossa in
the production mode is to run the script:

    ./build.sh

To start the server:

    ./start_prod.sh

To restart the server:

    ./restart_prod.sh
